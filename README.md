<em>My LeetCode practice ground...</em>

## First words

Hi, it is Feb 12th 2021, but it is the first day of our Lunar New Year. And to celebrate Year of the Ox, I want to make one of my dream last year come true. 

I love, practicing, coding and improving myself to be a better version, and, this is the response. I am running out of word, so here we go.

## Languages

I am using Go and Python as tools. But I hope there are more than these 2 languages in this project.

Thanks in advance!
